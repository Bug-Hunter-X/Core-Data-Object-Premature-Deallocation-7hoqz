This repository demonstrates a common error in Objective-C Core Data programming: premature deallocation of fetched objects due to improper memory management. The `bug.m` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from not correctly retaining fetched managed objects, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior when the object is accessed after it has been deallocated. The solution highlights the importance of proper retain/release cycles, or better yet, using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) for safer memory management.
